# Deploy Your Task Management App to GitHub Pages (Free)

## Step 1: Download Your Code
Download all the files from this Replit workspace to your computer.

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
2. Name it something like "task-management-app"
3. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README (you'll upload your files)

## Step 3: Upload Your Code
Upload all these files to your GitHub repository:
- package.json
- vite.config.ts
- tsconfig.json
- tailwind.config.ts
- postcss.config.js
- components.json
- index.html (in root)
- client/ folder (entire folder)
- server/ folder (entire folder) 
- shared/ folder (entire folder)

## Step 4: GitHub Pages Setup
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch
5. Select "/ (root)" folder
6. Click Save

## Step 5: Build Configuration
GitHub Pages will need a build script. Your package.json already has the right scripts.

## Your App Will Be Live At:
https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]

## Important Notes:
- GitHub Pages hosts static sites for free
- Your app will work exactly the same
- Data resets on each visit (in-memory storage)
- No server costs or payment methods required
